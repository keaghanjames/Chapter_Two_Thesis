# Chapter_Two_Thesis
Scripts associated with the production of Chapter Two, Multiple diversification and preservation models can make combined-evidence phylogenies more imbalanced but only a few make them look like empirical trees

1. Helper functions including tree building functions for each of the diversification models and sampling functions for each of the preservation regimes
2. Script for simulating trees under each combination of diversification model and preservation regieme
3. Script for analysing imbalance of trees simulated under each combination of diversification and preservation regime
4. Script for estimating diversification parameters of empirical trees with CladDS and then simulating trees with those parameters under every combination of diversification model and preservation regime
5. Script for analysing the imbalance of trees simulated from parameter values of empirical trees estimate with CladDS
6. Script for making lolipop graph of empirical trees

CI_simulation_output_ne100.csv contains the input parameters and output values of the trees simulated under every combination of diversification model and preservation regime.
